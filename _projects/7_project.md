### Funding and Collaboration

This project is funded by Digital Futures, a cross-disciplinary research center established by KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University, and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. The initiative brings together experts in artificial intelligence, educational technology, and engineering pedagogy to address critical challenges in STEM education.

### Broader Impact

The research contributes to the global conversation about the future of education in the digital age, addressing critical questions about how AI can enhance rather than replace human learning and teaching. By focusing on multimodal approaches, the project recognizes that effective learning involves multiple senses and cognitive processes, paving the way for more inclusive and accessible educational experiences.

The work also aligns with efforts to address workforce development challenges in an increasingly AI-driven economy, ensuring that engineering graduates are well-prepared for careers that will require collaboration with intelligent systems and continuous learning in rapidly evolving technological landscapes.
