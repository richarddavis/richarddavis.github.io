# Jekyll al-folio Project Guidelines

This is a Jekyll-based academic website using the al-folio theme (https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

## Project Structure
- `_config.yml`: Main Jekyll configuration file
- `_layouts/`: HTML templates for different page types
- `_includes/`: Reusable HTML components and partials
- `_sass/`: SCSS stylesheets for the theme
- `_pages/`: Static pages (about, CV, publications, etc.)
- `_posts/`: Blog posts in markdown format
- `_projects/`: Project showcase items
- `_news/`: News/announcement items
- `_bibliography/`: BibTeX files for academic publications
- `_data/`: YAML data files (CV, repositories, socials, etc.)
- `assets/`: Static assets (images, CSS, JS, PDFs, etc.)

## Jekyll Conventions
- Use YAML front matter for all content files
