# Template Documentation Review Rule

At the beginning of every chat session:

1. Quickly scan the project's key documentation files to refresh context, especially changes since the last session.
2. Prioritize these Markdown files for reference:
   - [README.md](mdc:README.md)
   - [INSTALL.md](mdc:INSTALL.md)
   - [FAQ.md](mdc:FAQ.md)
   - [CUSTOMIZE.md](mdc:CUSTOMIZE.md)
   - [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - [LICENSE](mdc:LICENSE)
3. If working on specific topics (e.g., deployment, customization, contributing), read the corresponding documentation section in detail before suggesting changes.
4. Cross-check answers and code edits against the official al-folio template docs to maintain compatibility.
5. Cite documentation sources in responses when relevant (link to file and section).

Following this rule ensures answers align with the al-folio template guidelines and reduces misinformation.
